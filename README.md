The process of predicting house prices involves several key steps, including data collection, data exploration/visualization, data pre-processing, feature selection, exploratory data analysis, data standardization, testing, training, and splitting model training, accuracy detection of the model, accuracy comparison, and explainable AI (XAI) techniques. These steps are aimed at training machine learning algorithms to accurately predict house prices based on historical data. After collecting the data and exploring it visually, pre-processing techniques such as data cleaning and data reduction may be

applied. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, while data reduction involves removing irrelevant columns that won't contribute to the model's training. Feature selection is also performed to select the most relevant features that are likely to impact house prices. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is then conducted to analyze and summarize the data using visualization techniques. Data standardization, such as converting categorical data into binary using one-hot encoding, may be performed to prepare the data for model training. The data is then split into testing and training sets to evaluate the model's accuracy. The machine learning model is trained using different algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression. The accuracy of each model is detected and compared to identify the best-performing algorithm for house price prediction. Additionally, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are used to interpret the factors that drive the predicted house prices, providing valuable insights for decision-making in the real estate market.
